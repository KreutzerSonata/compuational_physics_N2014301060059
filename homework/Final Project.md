#Random Walks and Diffusion  

##Abstract  

In this final task, we investigate the properties of a random system by firstly introducing the random walk model, then compare it
with the diffusive equation(in two dimension), finally check the statistical interpretation of entropy.  

##Background  

Generally we take the evolution of *any* system as determinitstic, which means in principle we can find some mathematical rules(such
as Newton's laws) to describe the their motions. However, in previous chapters, we have seen that a good many of such systems are *unpredicable* because
of the arising of chaos. In this task, we investigate another kind of systems ivolving randomness, they are actually both determinitstic
and predicable, but the tremendous number of *degree of freedom* makes it infeasible and useless to calculate the results by solving
each motion equation. Instead, a statistical method gives us a more concise and comprehensible
