#Planetary Orbits  

Homework 4.9  

##Abstract  

This task provides with a simulation of planetary orbits under the effort of gravity. As a conclusion, the inverse-square law is the
only form of gravitational force which maintains a planet in a stable orbit, otherwise the orbit rotates with elapsing, and the period
it remains stable is dependent on the ellipticity of the orbit with the same gravitational force form.  

##Background  

Since planetary motion is a typical oscillatory problem, we use Euler-Cromer method instead of Euler method to do the simulation just
as we did with pendulum. The rule for planetary motion is described through Newton's second law with two second-order ODEs which treat
the motion as a two-dimension problem. As usual the equations should be reduced to four first-order ones, thus converted into difference
form as follows
